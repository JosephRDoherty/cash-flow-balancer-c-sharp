<h3>Welcome to the Money Management System by J|Labs</h3>
<p>MMS is a cash flow prediction and balancing web application built by Joe Doherty.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Expense Tracking</h4>
<p>
MMS offers a comprehensive expense-tracking system. At the top of the Information section you will find multiple tabs to view expenses due across 8 weeks, 
separated by paydays. Each payday-payday section is 14 days, and thus called a "Fortnight". These are all tracked in real-time and will be automatically updated as
the weeks go on, or if the pay schedule is changed. *Note, bills are sorted by date, resulting in bills from the previous month being put at the bottom of the list,
despite the fact that they are due sooner. This is a minor inconvience that will be a major inconvience to solve. Just be aware of this as you are using this
part of the MMS.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>All Bills</h4>
<p>
This tab contains a list of all bills stored by the system. These are all sorted by due date, and includes the name, cost, and
due date.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>Pay Calendar</h4>
<p>
Finally is the "Pay Calendar". This displays 52 weeks of paydays and their associated costs. This is a useful tool for viewing cash flow across the next 12 months,
which could be useful for planning vacations and more.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>Stats</h4>
<p>
The "Stats" section displays various monthly and fortnightly stats, such as income, profit, budget tools, and more.
<hr>
<h5>Expected Income This Month</h5>
<p>
The "Expected Income This Month" section tracks
how many paychecks occur within the month, and updates automatically to display those "Magic Months" where there are 3 paychecks within a single month.
</p>
<hr>
<h5>Monthly Profit</h5>
<p>
Automatically calculates monthly profit based on the expected income and the monthly expenses.
</p>
<hr>
<h5>Fortnight Budgets</h5>
<p>
These "Fortnight Budgets" are attempts to calculate an ideal amount of money to save every paycheck, in order to have a consistent cash flow. These three are calculated
very differently:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fortnight Budget v1 is calculated by finding the percentage of annual expenses to annual income, and budgeting that percentage of each paycheck</li>
    <li>Fortnight Budget v2 is calculated by taking the total yearly expenses, and dividing it evenly across 26 paychecks</li>
    <li>Fortnight Budget v3 is the most complicated. It uses a prediction algorithm to find the bare minimum required to budget. More info below.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Fortnight Budget v3</h4>
<p>
The Fortnight Budget v3 accurately predicts the next 52 weeks of paychecks, and finds the amount needed to save every fortnight in order to never go above budget.
Sometimes, this will end up with $2400 saved up, only for it to drop considerably very quickly. With this model, there is little room for error, so maintaining the
constant, even flow of cash is required for accurate budgeting. The other models end up developing a savings well beyond the required amount, which could be useful for
building up a somewhat automatic buffer-zone or emergency fund. Fortnight Budget v3 actually ends up being less per-year than the expected yearly expenses. This is a 
paradox, but it has to do with the fact that these payday-payday periods are not falling perfectly within one year or the next. This has been tested up to 4 years ahead,
and is perfectly acceptable despite this fact. //CHECK THIS, IT MAY BE FORGETTING GAS AND FOOD, but I'm kinda thinking of making them separate anyways, since they're
more free-flowing.
